# Oblivion-Fortress
NTU Game Programming 2023 final project  
A 2D tower defense game, based on **Unity 2022.3.10**

## Game Overview
This is an innovative 2.5D tower defense game that introduces new mechanics, such as character control and resource gathering, setting it apart from traditional tower defense games.  
During the game, waves of enemies will launch attacks. Monsters will follow a path toward the main fortress and attempt to destroy it. Players must gather resources to obtain materials, which can then be used to construct defensive towers to fend off enemy assaults.  
The game features three main episode and endless mode, each offering four difficulty settings: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Expert.
